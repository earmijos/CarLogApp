# How to Change Your Netlify Site Name

Since you have a Netlify account, here's how to customize your site name:

## Steps to Change Site Name:

1. **Log in to Netlify**: Go to https://app.netlify.com and sign in

2. **Find Your Site**: 
   - Click on "Sites" in the top menu
   - Find your site: `fastidious-entremet-fa366b` (or look for the most recently added site)

3. **Access Site Settings**:
   - Click on your site name
   - Go to **Site settings** (or click the gear icon ⚙️)
   - In the left sidebar, click **"General"**

4. **Change Site Name**:
   - Look for **"Site details"** section
   - Find the **"Site name"** field
   - Change it to something professional like:
     - `carlog-app`
     - `my-carlog`
     - `carlog-demo`
     - `vehicle-log-app`
     - Or any name you prefer (must be available)

5. **Update Domain**:
   - Your new URL will be: `https://your-chosen-name.netlify.app`
   - Netlify will check if the name is available
   - If available, click **"Save"** or **"Update"**

6. **Redeploy** (if needed):
   - If you just changed the name, your site should automatically update
   - The new URL will work immediately
   - The old URL will redirect to the new one for a while

## Tips:
- Names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Must be unique across all Netlify sites
- Once changed, the old random URL will redirect to the new one
- You can also set up a custom domain later if you have one

## After Changing:
Once you have your new professional URL, let me know and I'll update the QR code!
